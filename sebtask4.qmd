# Task 2

What are the rankings of New York City’s main airports in terms of the total number of destinations served? Include columns for the following attributes:

Three-letter airport code Airport name Number of destinations Rank

Sort the results first by rank and, then, alphabetically by the three-letter airport code. Hint: use INNER JOIN to get airport names from airports table.

```{sql, connection=con}

SELECT
  a.faa AS airport_code,
  a.name AS airport_name,
  COUNT(f.dest) AS num_destinations,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(f.dest) DESC) AS rank
FROM
    airports a
INNER JOIN 
    flights f
ON
    a.faa = f.origin
WHERE a.tzone = 'America/New_York'
GROUP BY a.faa;
```

Which ten destination airports are served by the greatest number of seats from New York City? If airports are tied for the tenth place, ensure that all tied airports are included in the output. Include columns for the following attributes:

Three-letter airport code Airport name Number of seats Rank Sort the results first by rank and, then, alphabetically by the three-letter airport code. Hint: the number of seats information is in planes.seats; same way as above to get airport names.

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT
  a.faa AS airport_code,
  a.name AS airport_name,
  SUM(p.seats) AS num_seats,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(p.seats) DESC) AS rank

```

Tabulate the percentage of on-time departures for each hour of the day when the plane is scheduled to leave. Include columns for the following attributes:

Hour of the day Percentage of on-time departures, rounded to two decimal places Sort the results by the hour of the day. Hint: use flights.sched_dep_time / 100 (integer division) to get the hour of the day, and you do not need to show the hours in which there is no scheduled departure.

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT
  f.sched_dep_time / 100 AS hour_of_day,
  ROUND(
    100.0 * SUM(
      CASE
        WHEN f.dep_delay <= 0 THEN 1
        ELSE 0
      END
    ) / COUNT(*),
    2
  ) AS on_time_pct

ORDER BY
  hour_of_day;
```

HAVING
    COUNT(*) >= 100
ORDER BY
    rank, p.manufacturer, p.model;
```

SELECT 
    a.faa AS airport_code,
    a.name AS airport_name,
    w.precip = 0 AS is_dry,
    ROUND(
        100.0 * SUM(
            CASE 
                WHEN f.dep_delay <= 0 THEN 1
                ELSE 0
            END

```

What is the correlation coefficient between the mean temperature of the day and the mean departure delay on that day? Round the value to two decimal places. Provide the answer in the form of a table with one row and one column. Hint: calculate the AVG() of temperature for each day in 2013, and then the AVG() of departure delay for each day in 2013. After that, calculate the CORR() between these two sequences (of length 365 or less). Remember to INNER JOIN flights and weather.

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT 
    ROUND(CAST(CORR(daily_weather.temp, daily_flights.dep_delay) AS numeric), 2) AS correlation_coefficient
FROM (
    SELECT 
        f.year,
        f.month,
        f.day,
        AVG(w.temp) AS temp
    FROM
        flights f
    INNER JOIN
        weather w ON f.origin = w.origin AND f.time_hour = w.time_hour
    WHERE
        f.year = 2013
    GROUP BY
        f.year, f.month, f.day
) AS daily_weather
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT

        f.month,
        f.day,
        AVG(f.dep_delay) AS dep_delay
    FROM
        flights f
    WHERE
        f.year = 2013
    GROUP BY
        f.year, f.month, f.day
) AS daily_flights ON daily_weather.year = daily_flights.year AND daily_weather.month = daily_flights.month AND daily_weather.day = daily_flights.day;
```

Burlington, Vermont, lies almost exactly to the north of New York City. Is the mean flight time to Burlington International Airport (BTV) shorter when the wind blows from the south (between 135 and 225 degrees) compared to when it blows from the north (between 0 and 45 degrees as well as between 315 and 360 degrees)? Provide your answer in the form of a table with one row each for north and south winds, and two columns, named wind_direction and mean_air_time. Hint: CASE expression.

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT 
    wind_direction,
    ROUND(AVG(air_time), 2) AS mean_air_time
FROM (
    SELECT 
        f.air_time,
        CASE 
            WHEN w.wind_dir >= 135 AND w.wind_dir <= 225 THEN 'south'
            WHEN w.wind_dir >= 0 AND w.wind_dir <= 45 THEN 'north'
